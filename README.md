Learning some basics on shaders.

Nothing too crazy, but did some research online and here is some initial work.

This is really if anyone wants some very intro level examples of shaders.

I am using LOVE (www.love2d.org) and you will need at least 10.x+ to run this.

shaders that I have tried out:
- rotating colour for the bullet
- colour gradients for the power bar and explosions
- green crt with a scan line for the radar
- darkness overlay (not currently using it)
- noise (not currently using it)
- B&W (not currently using it)
- a passthu to just do original colour
