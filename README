Asteroids

Learning some basics on shaders.

Nothing too crazy, but did some research online and played around with HLSL stuff and here is some initial work.

I am using LOVE (www.love2d.org) and you will need at least 10.x+ to run this.

shaders that I have tried out:
- rotating colour for the bullet
- colour gradients for the power bar and explosions
- green crt with a scan line for the radar
- darkness overlay (not currently using it)
- a passthu to just do original colour
